# tabbar-swiftui
SwiftUI tab bar view that respects navigation stacks when tabs are switched (unlike the TabView implementation)

Working minimal example of the approach from [Amzd's gist here](https://gist.github.com/Amzd/2eb5b941865e8c5cccf149e6e07c8810)

This was answering [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57772137/tabview-resets-navigation-stack-when-switching-tabs)
